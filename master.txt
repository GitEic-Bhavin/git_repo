Switch from experiment.txt to main branch.
create master.txt and commit this.
git switch experiment_branch
This will create confict merge bcz, the file on master branch is master.txt
When you switch to confict_branch this master.txt will also be there in confict_brach.

so same content of master.txt will be there.

When you edit master.txt file in confict_branch.
the new content will be added.

When you try to merge conflict_branch to master branch.
Content of master.txt file will not be same for master branch and confilct_branch.

So, it will create confict.
